# StubJars

Creates a set of Java source files containing the minimum amount of
code to create a JAR with an identical public signature

## Release Notes
### v0.1.3
 - Added `throws` to generated method signatures that have orginally specified a method signature
 - Methods that were originally varargs are now correctly generated as varargs

## Passing Tests
* Creates a compilable set of Java source files for GSON

## Blocking Tests
* Creates a compilable set of Java source files for javac
* Creates a compilable set of Java source files for rt.jar

## Blocking Issues
* Generics and constructors are not playing well

Sample Error:
```text
stub_src\javax\lang\model\util\SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor7.java:6: error: constructor SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor6 in class SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor6<R#2,P> cannot be applied to given types;
protected SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor7(R arg0) {
                                                ^
  required: R#1
  found: no arguments
  reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
  where R#1,R#2,P are type-variables:
    R#1 extends Object declared in class SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor7
    R#2 extends Object declared in class SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor6
    P extends Object declared in class SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor6
```

* Doesn't have a public API for passing in Class objects directly

## How to use
1. Download StubJars
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/dmssargent/StubJars
    ```
1. Run StubJars, specifying the JARs you want to convert
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew run jarFileA.jar jarFileB.jar...
    ```
    
## Generated Source Directory
In the current directory after you run StubJars, you will find a folder
called stub_src. This folder is the result of the StubJars and it 
contains the Java source code stubs for the specified JAR files

### How to compile the generated source
It's simple, you can use the following one liner
```bash
    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac -d build/classes @sources.list
```
